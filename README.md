# DyConPro
DYnamic CONnectivity PROcessing (DCP) toolbox.  

MATLAB tools for computation, manipulation and processing of single-subject and group dynamic functional connectivity (dfc) tensors and matrices.  It includes a function for computing a time-varying, instantaneous measure of functional connectivity (function dcp_dcs; see Tobia et al, 2017 Human Brain Mapping) and numerous other functions to scale, binarize, transform to matrices, and analyze (e.g., neurocognitive network correlations, block GLMs) dfc tensors.
