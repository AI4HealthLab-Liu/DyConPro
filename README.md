# DyConPro
DYnamic CONnectivity PROcessing (DCP) toolbox.  

MATLAB tools for computation, manipulation and processing of single-subject and group dynamic functional connectivity (dfc) tensors and matrices.  It includes a function for computing a time-varying, instantaneous measure of functional connectivity (function dcp_dcs; see [Tobia et al., 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23821/full)) and numerous other functions to scale, binarize, transform to matrices, and analyze (e.g., neurocognitive network correlations, block GLMs) dfc tensors.

Recent update and first official release of DCP v1.1 (12/18/2018) now includes two example files to demo how to run some of the more intricate DCP functions. ALSO, now includes FC_SNAPSHOT, whic is a crude matlab workspace gui for easy viewing of FC matrices and dFC tensors in 3 viewing modes, (1) time-dependent matrices, (2) time-dependent circle graph, and (3) time-dependent brain rendering. Some of these newer functionalities are, of course, a ongoing WIP!
